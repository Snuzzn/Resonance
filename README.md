## Brief
Resonance allows users to **create topics** and **save content** to these topics by providing a link. Each piece of content is displayed as a card that be clicked to **direct the user** to the appropriate web page. The card can be marked as **consumed** and **favourited**. **Filters** are available to organise and display this content e.g. content that is yet to be consumed. The **size of each card** can be changed via a slider to suit the user's preference. **Light and dark modes **are also available. 

Before using the app, users must register with their name, email and password if they do not have an account.

## Web stack
Resonance is a single-page web app built with Next.js on the frontend, styled using the Material-UI React component library. Clearbit's Logo API and Youtube's Img API are used to display visual info for each card.
The RESTful API backend is built using Next's API Routes. A MongoDB database is used to store user information and content.
